# Natural language processing project to analyze and classify the sentiment of imdb reviews
Project Overview:
1) Achieved data analysis and data cleaning of the imdb database containing the sevreal reviews and their sentiments 
2) Created a histogram for the length of the reviews 
3) Created a countplot to compare the number of positive and negative sentiments
4) Created a function to remove the punctuation and stopwords from each review
5) Used the Countvectorizer to transform the given reviews into vectors on the basis of frequency of words
6) Used the naive bayes classifier to train the model on the training data and making predictions using the testing data
7) Evaluated the model using the confusion matrix, classification report and the seaborn heatmap

# Code and resources used:
